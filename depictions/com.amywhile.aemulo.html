<h3>The ultimate NFC Tweak for iOS!</h3>
<p>Ever wanted to add your most used NFC Cards to Wallet on your phone? Introducing Aemulo…</p>
<p>Aemulo allows you to read, write and emulate tags from one app. It also has the ability to add cards to Wallet so you can invoke them from the lock screen. Aemulo features a modern UI designed for the latest iPhones with lots of functionality.</p>
<h3>What devices does it support?</h3>
<p>Aemulo has support for all iPhones running iOS 13 or higher.</p>
<p><strong>Note: The iPhone 6S/Plus and iPhone SE have limited reading support and no writing support. They fully support emulation.</strong></p>
<h3>What is the difference with the trial version?</h3>
<p>The trial version of Aemulo is almost the same as the full version. The only difference is that the free version does not support Add to Wallet. This is due to on going server costs involved with supporting this feature. By paying for the full version you are helping to support continued development.</p>
<h3>What tags can it emulate?</h3>
<p>Emulation currently only supports Desfire and ISO-Dep Types. Work is being done to add support for other MiFare Types in future updates, for free. Support is not guranteed for all of your tags.</p>
<h3>Does it support Amiibo?</h3>
<p>Reading and Writing Amiibo is supported. Writing Amiibo requires blank NTAG 215 tags that can only be written to once. Research is being done to add the ability to emulate Amiibo directly from Aemulo.</p>
<h3>Do I require a jailbreak?</h3>
<p>A jailbreak is required to use the Aemulo app and any other feature it adds. Passes added to Wallet will not work with tweaks disabled. Passes will not work on Apple Watch.</p>
<h3>Do I need an internet connection?</h3>
<p>Aemulo will function almost entirely without an internet connection. An internet connection is however required for Adding a Tag to Wallet as they need to be remotely codesigned. This is an Apple limitation.</p>
<h3>Anything else?</h3>
<p>Aemulo allows you to send commands directly to NFC Tags and to the NFC Chip in your phone itself, only use this if you know what you’re doing. Aemulo will also enable background tag reading on older iPhone models allowing you to read NDEF Tags without even opening the app or assigning a Shortcut to an NFC Tag.</p>
